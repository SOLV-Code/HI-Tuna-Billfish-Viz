## HI-Tuna-Billfish-Viz

**Data, Plotting Code, and Shiny App for Hawaiian Tuna and Billfish** 

### Repository Overview

#### Shiny App

This is the key folder. It contains the latest stable version of the plotting
functions and the processed data set. It also contains the code for the Shiny app.
Once you [Clone](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) or 
[fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) the repository, you can run the app locally
locally using the script *1_Run_Locally.R*. Or you can just access 
the app on the [server](https://solv-code.shinyapps.io/hi_tunabillfishdataviz/ ).

*Note*: Not all plot variations have been incorporated into the App yet.
The full set is included in the pdf handouts on [dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ud2cbxwi9poh61b/AABChijucRhx1J8bz2YX3mLJa?dl=0 ).


#### Data
This contains the raw data files downloaded from LINK, and the code used to
process the raw data into a compact format to use for the app.
It also includes a lookup file with reference info for each of the 
species labels in the raw data (e.g. genus, fishery group)


#### Function Testing
This contains various scripts to test out the plotting functions.
you can also use these scripts to generate pdf handouts of the plots
shown in the app.

DATA SET: Hawaii Reported Landings
AGENCY: NOAA Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center
SOURCE: https://www.pifsc.noaa.gov/wpacfin/hi/dar/Pages/hi_data_3.php
RETRIEVED: 21 October 2016

Notes:
- Using annual totals for this illustration, but there are seasonal fluctuations in the data

- "There may be some discepancies between pounds caught and pounds sold values from 2000 onward,
 because the pounds caught is from the Longline Logbooks, Dealer's Reports and 
 Fisherman's Catch Reports data. Pounds sold, value and price/pound is 
 from the Dealer's Reports." 
 
Data clean-up step
- Can access only 1 year at time (choose "ANNUAL")
- save web table as xls file
- open xls file, delete title row and blank row, then save as csv

- Could try to automate the downloads, but department websites tend to prevent any kind of scraping

- Could set up the data processing script to read xls files, but the available packages 
for this require other software to be installed (Perl, Java). For options, check
https://www.r-bloggers.com/read-excel-files-from-r/ and
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6099243/read-an-excel-file-directly-from-a-r-script

- In this data set, there will only be one extra xls file added each year, so the
effort to automate this step is not worth it.
